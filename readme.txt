Provides a scrolling field without scrollbars for pictures with huge horizontal dimensions. Especially useful for panorama pictures.

This plugin is a rewrite of a JavaScript snippet called PhotoNav. It provides for easy integration of panaorama pictures in a Wordpress page throught using shortcode. The user can "rotate" the view of the panorama by moving the mouse over the image area or dragging the image.
Additional features include an integration with jQuery Colorbox and animated scrolling.
